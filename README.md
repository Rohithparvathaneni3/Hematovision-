# HematoVision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification

## Project Description
HematoVision is a deep learning project that uses transfer learning to classify blood cells into four types: eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils. It helps in medical diagnosis by automating cell classification.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Transfer Learning
- Flask (for web app)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
- **Demo/** – Contains video/screenshots of the project in action.
- **Documentation/** – Includes project report and supporting documents.
- **app.py** – Flask web application script.
- **model.h5** – Trained deep learning model.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run `app.py` using Flask.
4. Open browser and test with blood cell images.
